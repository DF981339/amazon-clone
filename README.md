# Amazon-Clone-Ecommerce-Website

### Web app is hosted on Firebase: https://clone-db7a6.web.app/
---
## Why and How I work on this project
#### I wanted to learn one of the most popular front-end framework and build a full stack ecommerce app
#### I found out many people were building clones of some famous website nowadays. Therefore, I decided to build an Amazon clone
#### In this project, I used `React` for UI, `Firebase` for authentication and data storage, and `Stripe` for payment functionality

## Some screenshots and words briefly show how this project looks like
### This is the Amazon look-alike home page with some hard-coded products in the front-end

## What I would like to improve if I had more time
* Learn and try to use Next.js and Redux to re-write the front-end
* Use some API to import some fake prodects instead of hard-coding the products in the front-end
* Add create address section to have an user-inputed address instead of hard-coding the address in the front-end
* Make the searching functionality to work and create product detail page
* Try to add more login method (google, facebook, etc.) and payment method (apple, paypal, etc.)
* Implement more functionality to make it looks like a real ecommerce website
